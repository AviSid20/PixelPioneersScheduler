                <p style="color: black;"><small>From this project, I gained valuable experience in Git and version control, which I believe will be incredibly beneficial in future collaborations and projects. Additionally, diving into the intricacies of front-end development for applications has expanded my skill set and provided me with a deeper understanding of creating user-friendly interfaces and engaging experiences</small></p>

                <p style="color: black;"><small>One skill that I found improved dramatically was the ability to debug problems in a project quickly. I now find that finding the source of a bug is more intuitive, and I have gained a better understanding of the tools that help me achieve this goal as well.
                    Another thing I feel I’ve gained is the understanding of the underlying reasons behind structuring things a certain way within code – that working on code given a certain structure may become more difficult later compared to other methods. Getting firsthand experience with this proved a great learning experience, and made structuring software in future projects more intuitive!</small></p>

Through hands-on experience, he developed a deeper understanding of how these testing methodologies contribute to the reliability and stability of software applications. </small></p>
