            <h2>Post-Moderm Development</h2>
<h3>Lessons Learned<br></h3>
Starting iterations as soon as possible is crucial. It's important to overestimate how difficult and complex features, user stories, and tasks might be. We might want to consider assigning roles like project manager within the team. We could switch this up each time we start a new iteration. This person would be responsible for checking in with everyone on the team regularly to make sure we're staying on track to deliver on time.
    <h3>If We Could Start Over <br></h3>
    Reflecting on our team's development experience, we recognize the need to improve our approach in several areas. Specifically, we should have initiated tasks earlier to provide more flexibility and mitigate last-minute rushes. Additionally, a proactive stance in anticipating obstacles and planning accordingly would have been beneficial. We also acknowledge the importance of fostering a culture of continuous improvement and feedback within the team. By addressing these areas, we can be more effective in our future projects. 
<h3>Conclusions <br></h3>
Collaborating within a group presents its challenges, but the rewards are significant. Through this experience, I've honed my communication skills and developed the ability to improvise solutions on short notice. It's essential to take into account individuals' skills and interests when delegating tasks. Additionally, anticipating worst-case scenarios and allocating time for unforeseen issues is crucial. Thorough testing of all components is indispensable to ensure a successful outcome.
