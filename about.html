                <h3><strong>Avneet Sidhu</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: black;">Through this project, I have gained valuable insights and practical experience in Database Management, enhancing my skills in organizing, manipulating, and retrieving data efficiently. I also gained a better understanding of the debugging tools which have been incredibly helpful.</p>
                
                <h3><strong>Eman Elmahi</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: black;">From this project, I gained valuable experience in Git and version control, which will be incredibly beneficial in future projects. I've learned many interesting design principles for front-end development on the app and the website and gained a deeper understanding of making user-friendly interfaces.</p>
                
                <h3><strong>Gabriel Barnabé</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: black;">One skill that I found improved dramatically was the ability to debug problems in a project quickly. I now find that finding the source of a bug is more intuitive, and I have gained a better understanding of the tools that help me achieve this goal as well.
                    Another thing I feel I’ve gained is the understanding of the underlying reasons behind structuring things a certain way within code – that working on code given a certain structure may become more difficult later compared to other methods. Getting firsthand experience with this proved a great learning experience, and made structuring software in future projects more intuitive!</p>
                
                <h3><strong>Lin Li</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: black;">A skill I've gained from working on this project was desiging visually appealing user interfaces which enhanced my skills in creating intuitive designs.</small></p>
                
                <h3><strong>Victor Aderinto</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: black;">Working on this project, I have gained valuable insights into the significance of rigorous unit and system testing practices. Through hands-on experience, I developed a deeper understanding of how these testing methodologies contribute to the reliability of apps. </p>
